# XY-TI
Website for a fictitious company called XY-TI

Quick introduction:

In my IT Technician classes, my teacher asked us to create a website for a fictional company, that is the result for that request. 
I used only HTML and CSS technologies in this project, for that reason the outcome is quite simple.
With that being said, I really hope you enjoy the final result.
